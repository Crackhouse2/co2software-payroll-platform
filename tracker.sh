## CURRENT STATUS: MILESTONE 1+ COMPLETE

### COMPLETED FRAGMENTS
- Fragment 001: Repository Foundation (DONE)
- Fragment 002: Authentication Foundation (DONE)  
- Fragment 003: Core Business Logic (DONE)

### NEXT TARGET
- Fragment 004: Employee Management (CRUD + forms)

## WORKING SYSTEM COMPONENTS

### Infrastructure (AWS Free Tier - $0/month)
- DynamoDB: User invitations + future payroll data
- Lambda Functions: Authentication + payroll calculation  
- API Gateway: RESTful endpoints with CORS
- Cognito: User authentication system
- CDK: Infrastructure as code deployment

### Authentication System (Production Ready)
- Admin Login: admin@co2software.co.uk / AdminPass123!
- JWT Token Management: Secure session handling
- Protected Routes: Dashboard requires authentication
- Role-Based: Admin/Payroll/Manager/Employee roles
- Invitation System: Admin-controlled user creation

### Core Business Logic
- Payroll Calculation: 40 hours x $25 = $1000 gross â†’ $200 tax â†’ $800 net
- Multi-tenant: co2software tenant configured
- Tax Logic: Working 20% tax calculation (100 * 0.2 = 20)

### Professional UI
- Admin Interface: Login, user management, payroll testing using react remix served via AWS Lambda
- Protected Dashboard: Authenticated landing page  
- Config Management: Auto-detection of API endpoints
- Responsive Design: Mobile + desktop ready

### Testing Foundation
- Unit Tests: Payroll calculation (100% pass rate)
- E2E Tests: Complete user journey testing
- Integration Tests: Live API validation
- Test Commands: npm test

## WORKING COMMANDS

### Development
npm run deploy:local    # Deploy to AWS
npm test               # Run all tests  
npm run dev            # Start development server
npm run build          # Build all packages

### Demo Capabilities
1. Login: admin@co2software.co.uk / AdminPass123!
2. Calculate Payroll: Enter hours/rate, see tax calculation
3. Invite Users: Send real invitations via admin panel
4. Protected Access: Dashboard blocks unauthenticated users
5. AWS Backend: Live Lambda calculations

## ARCHITECTURE FOUNDATION

### Monorepo Structure
packages/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/           # Common types and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/   # CDK deployment code
â”œâ”€â”€ workers/         # Real-time operations
â”œâ”€â”€ processors/      # Batch processing
â”œâ”€â”€ web-worker/      # Worker portal frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ web-payroll/     # Payroll operator interface
â””â”€â”€ domains/         # Business logic
    â”œâ”€â”€ employees/
    â”œâ”€â”€ timesheets/

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React/TypeScript
- Backend: AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- Database: DynamoDB (single table design)
- Auth: AWS Cognito
- Infrastructure: CDK TypeScript
- Testing: Jest + E2E automation

## FRAGMENT 004 PLAN: Employee Management

### Fragment 004a: Employee Database Schema (10 mins)
- DynamoDB table design for employees
- Basic CRUD operations
- TypeScript interfaces

### Fragment 004b: Employee Forms + Validation (15 mins)  
- Create/edit employee forms
- Zod validation schemas
- Form submission handlers

### Fragment 004c: Employee List/Search UI (15 mins)
- Employee listing page
- Search and filter functionality
- Integration with forms

## DEBUGGING INFO

### Known Working Flows
- Admin login â†’ Dashboard access (WORKING)
- Payroll calculation â†’ Correct tax calculation (WORKING)
- User invitation â†’ Email sent (check implementation)
- AWS deployment â†’ Infrastructure up and running (WORKING)

### Dependencies
- Node.js version: (check package.json)
- AWS CLI configured: Required for deployment
- Environment: Local development working

### Security Notes
- FIXED: Admin login separated from main login (security improvement made)
- JWT tokens properly validated (WORKING)
- Protected routes implemented (WORKING)
- Role-based access control ready (WORKING)

## IMPORTANT CONTEXT NOTES

### Collaboration Pattern That Works
1. Fragment approach: Small, complete, testable pieces (â‰¤50 lines)
2. Short scripts: Executable bash scripts with embedded code
3. Quick validation: 5-15 minute execution per fragment
4. Build incrementally: Each fragment builds on previous work

### What NOT to do
- Long architectural discussions
- Complex artifacts without execution path  
- Phase-based approach (we use fragments)
- Over-engineering before validation

### Successful Script Format
#!/bin/bash
echo "Fragment XXX: Brief Description"
# Create specific files with embedded code
cat > path/to/file.ts << 'EOF'
// Complete, working code here
EOF
echo "Test: How to validate this works"

## READY FOR NEW CONVERSATION?

To continue in fresh conversation, provide:
1. This PROJECT_STATUS.md content
2. "Continue from Fragment 004" 
3. Any specific issues encountered

Expected response:
- Short script for Fragment 004a
- Complete and testable
- Builds on existing foundation
- Clear validation steps
