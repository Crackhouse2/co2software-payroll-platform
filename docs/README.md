## Architecture Philosophy

This project uses **micro-fragment development**:
- Each fragment is complete and testable
- Clear success criteria for every step
- Build working system incrementally
- Scale complexity as needed

## Fragment Standards

Each fragment follows strict standards:
- Executable script with clear naming
- Exact file creation count
- Technical validation requirements  
- Functional success criteria
- Transparent collaboration protocol
